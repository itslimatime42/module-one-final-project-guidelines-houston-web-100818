#Houston Shady Bar Search README

Welcome to the Houston Shady Bar Search. This app returns yelp reviews and ratings for various establishments in the greater Houston area. The databases for this app was seeded using the Yelp Fusion business search API and scraping yelp pages.

Functions include: searching for bars by name, searching for bars using keywords that show up in their reviews, finding Houston's angriest user (most 1 star reviews), and searching reviews for a "discreet" bar. After launching, navigate the various menus of the app to explore yelp information in different ways.

Download our repo into a folder of your choice, and run the program from the terminal by typing ```rake run``` while in the main directory.

Contributors for this app are Robert Schulte and Megan Farley.
